# BasicNN
A java neural network implementation without use of any external libraries. It can be trained on any processed inputs and trained networks can be saved and loaded using JSON serialization.

The aim of this project was to reduce a neural network down to it's bare bones in order to truely understand how a neural network works 'under the hood'.

The mnist digit dataset has been used as an example input for the neural network. Additonally, there is an implementation of a GUI canvas for drawing digits to input and test on the neural network trained for the mnist digit dataset.
